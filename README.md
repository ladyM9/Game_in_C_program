# Game_in_C_program
This project is based on the STM32H742ZIT6, with games displayed on the TFT LCD display.
The menu is navigated using a joystick, and the games are played using an accelerometer.

 In this repository, you can find a scaling script (written in Python) for scaling a maze for display on an LCD TFT, as well as the main code used to display the menu and games. Other parts of the code describe the menu, the first game, the second game, and the objects in the games.
